## Tauri + SvelteKit + TypeScript

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, SvelteKit and TypeScript in Vite.

## Development setup 

To get started, cd into the project's directory and run the following commands 

```bash
    npm install
    npm run download-ffmpeg
    npm run tauri dev
```

## Testing 

The app has two primary components, the Svelte & Typescript frontend and the Rust backend. There are tests for both of these.

### Typescript tests

to run the typescript tests (which are written using vitest), you can simply run 

```bash
    npm test
```

to get a code coverage report, run 

```bash
    npm run coverage
```

This will also generate a coverage directory with the coverage report 

### Rust tests 

The rust tests are written using cargo's built in testing suite. To run, use the following steps 

```bash
    cd src-tauri
    cargo test 
```

To generate a coverage report, run the following command (also from within the src-tauri directory)

```bash
    cargo coverage
```
